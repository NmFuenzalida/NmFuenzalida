### Hi there , IÂ´m Nicolas Morales ðŸ‘‹, I am a nurse currently living in a narrow and quite beautiful country at the end of the world called Chile. Passionate about technology since childhood and recently I realized how powerful it would be to combine both worlds so I am currently entering the world of programming to be a contribution in the world of technology and health



- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ruby on rails
- ðŸ‘¯ I would love to work for a health startup or a technology company related to the area.
